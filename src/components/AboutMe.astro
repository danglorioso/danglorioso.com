                I'm currently a senior at <a href="https://www.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tufts University</a> studying Computer Science, where I work as a 
                teaching assistant for Algorithms and a project manager for <a href="https://www.jumbocode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JumboCode</a>—a student 
                organization that builds pro bono software for local non-profits. I'm currently leading a 
                team of 10 developers creating a data analysis web application for a client.

                My fascination with technology began at 8 years old when I built my first website in 
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/welcomescreen/ilife/iweb-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iWeb</a> on an 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook#iBook_G4_(2003-2006)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBook G4</a> for a snack 
                business I ran out of my house, aptly named Dan's Snack Shack. 
                Even though it was just a static menu page and blog, I became intrigued by the ways in which 
                you could creatively leverage technology for a purpose. That curiosity kept me poking around 
                and teaching myself new things. By 4th grade, I was running a Minecraft server for kids in my 
                grade and reading Java how-to books to teach myself how to code up custom plugins and 
                mini-games to play with my friends.

                These days, I'm most excited by building solutions that genuinely improve people's lives. The reason I was 
                drawn to technology in the first place—its ability to solve real problems and meet human needs—is what 
                still motivates me today. The work may have grown more complex, but the core appeal remains the same.
