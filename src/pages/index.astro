							I'm currently a senior at <a href="https://www.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tufts University</a> studying Computer Science, where I work as a 
							teaching assistant for Algorithms and a project manager for <a href="https://www.jumbocode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JumboCode</a>—a student 
							organization that builds pro bono software for local non-profits. I'm currently leading a 
							team of 10 developers creating a data analysis web application for a client.
						</p>
						<p class="text-text-tertiary text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
							My fascination with technology began at 8 years old when I built my first website using 
							<a href="https://www.apple.com/welcomescreen/ilife/iweb-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iWeb</a> on an 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook#iBook_G4_(2003-2006)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBook G4</a> for a snack 
							business I ran out of my house, aptly named Dan's Snack Shack. 
							Even though it was just a static menu page and blog, I became intrigued by the ways in which 
							you could creatively leverage technology for a purpose. That curiosity kept me poking around 
							and teaching myself new things. By 4th grade, I was running a Minecraft server for kids in my 
							grade and reading Java how-to books to teach myself how to code-up custom plugins and 
							mini-games to play with my friends.
						</p>
						<p class="text-text-tertiary text-lg leading-relaxed">
							These days, I'm most excited by building solutions that genuinely improve people's lives. The reason I was 
							drawn to technology in the first place-its ability to solve real problems and meet human needs—is what 
							still motivates me today. The work may have grown more complex, but the core appeal remains the same.
