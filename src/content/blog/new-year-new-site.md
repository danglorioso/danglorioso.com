After years of paying to host a variety of beautiful (may I say) coming soon pages, I have finally launched [danglorioso.com](https://danglorioso.com), my personal portfolio and home to my plethora of ever-evolving side projects!

Those that know me well know that I’ve had this domain for years, locking it down from the other Dan Glorioso over five years ago (sorry other Dan’s—hit me up, though), and have been using tons of subdomains for various projects, but funnily enough never published anything meaningful on this root domain. 

When I first bought this domain, I was hosting a WordPress blog on it—paying nearly $400 a year to host it. At the time, that was the most I knew about web development. As I began college and learned more about programming, especially through my work in [JumboCode](https://www.jumbocode.org/), it only made sense to create my own site from scratch and host it myself. So that’s what I did and have been working on on-and-off for the past year.

Admittedly, it has taken awhile to publish this site because I’ve been busy with schoolwork, working on other passion projects, and have re-starting it several times because I wanted it to be just right. 

This version of my site is built in [Astro](https://astro.build), a fairly new tool that I started exploring two summers ago.
