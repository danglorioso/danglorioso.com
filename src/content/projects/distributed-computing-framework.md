## Project Overview

Built from the ground up to address the specific needs of machine learning workloads in distributed environments, focusing on fault tolerance and efficient resource utilization.

## Architecture

The framework uses a master-worker architecture with automatic load balancing and failure recovery mechanisms.

## Performance Results

Benchmark tests showed significant improvements over existing solutions, particularly for iterative ML algorithms.

## Future Plans

Planning to add support for GPU clusters and integration with popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
