## Project Overview

Building a modern collaborative coding environment that combines the power of VS Code with real-time collaboration features similar to Google Docs.

## Current Progress

- ‚úÖ Real-time collaborative editing
- ‚úÖ Syntax highlighting and autocompletion
- ‚úÖ Integrated terminal
- üîÑ AI code suggestions (in progress)
- üìù Debugging tools (planned)

## Technical Challenges

Implementing operational transformation for real-time collaboration while maintaining code syntax integrity has been the most interesting challenge so far.

## Next Steps

Working on integrating OpenAI's Codex for intelligent code suggestions and implementing a robust debugging interface.
