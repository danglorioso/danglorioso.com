## Project Overview

This project combines my passion for machine learning and data visualization to create an educational tool that makes neural networks more accessible and understandable.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch neural networks learn in real-time
- **Interactive Architecture Builder**: Drag and drop to create custom network architectures
- **Performance Metrics**: Live tracking of loss, accuracy, and gradient flows
- **Educational Mode**: Step-by-step explanations of forward and backward propagation

## Technical Implementation

The platform uses a modern web stack with WebGL for high-performance graphics rendering and a Python backend for actual neural network computations.

## Impact

The platform has been adopted by several educational institutions and has helped thousands of students better understand neural network concepts.
